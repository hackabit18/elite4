Team Elite4 intends to create a system, where users can create content without using a mouse or keyboard, but rather, their hands. Their models will be combined with the power of Neural Networks to appropriately generate a 3d representation of the same, something that they will be able to view in a Virtual Reality Environment. 
More information will be available here as we go along!

A major part of our project, i.e. to convert a single 2d image to 3d is inspired by the following github repo:
https://github.com/chrischoy/3D-R2N2

Our testcase: Conversion of a 2d image of a chair to 3d was successfully tested.
